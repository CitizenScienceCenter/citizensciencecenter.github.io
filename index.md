### Shoutouts

None of this work would be possible without these great projects and their help (either through open source tools or providing free access to open source orgs):

* ![https://github.com/CitizenScienceCenter/citizensciencecenter.github.io/raw/master/img/browserstack.png](https://browserstack.com) - Their tools allow testing on mobile devices that the budget of any company would struggle to afford. Creating a test suite to run on all Android and iOS devices, for example, means that none of our team is limited in the operating systems we develop on, nor on the phones we use
* ![https://github.com/CitizenScienceCenter/citizensciencecenter.github.io/raw/master/img/basecamp.png](https://basecamp.com) - Basecamp generously provides free project management to all not for profit and open source orgs, so we can link our development teams with every other member of the team. They are also just an awesome company.
* ![https://github.com/CitizenScienceCenter/citizensciencecenter.github.io/raw/master/img/github.png](https://github.com) - You are here, so you know it. These people are magical. Free everything for open source. The heart of our work would not exist or be available for you to use without them.
